# Operations

All queries below run in the Supabase Studio SQL editor (or psql as `postgres`).

## Health check

```sql
select * from ingest_health;
```

Healthy: both rows have a recent `last_success_at`, `consecutive_failures = 0`, and
`spots_last_hour > 0`. SOTAwatch can legitimately insert nothing for a while when the epoch has not
changed; `last_success_at` still advances.

`last_error` is the most recent error ever recorded and is not cleared by a later success. Compare
`last_error_at` with `last_success_at` before worrying about it.

## Why am I not seeing spots?

Work down the chain.

1. Are the cron jobs scheduled and active?
   ```sql
   select jobid, jobname, schedule, active from cron.job;
   select jobname, status, return_message, start_time
   from cron.job_run_details d join cron.job j using (jobid)
   order by start_time desc limit 20;
   ```
2. Did the HTTP calls reach the functions? pg_net keeps recent responses:
   ```sql
   select id, status_code, content::text, created
   from net._http_response order by created desc limit 20;
   ```
   A null `status_code` with an error message usually means the Vault secrets are missing or
   wrong. Check they exist (values are secrets; do not paste them anywhere):
   ```sql
   select name, created_at from vault.secrets where name like 'longlines_%';
   ```
   A 401 means the service-role key in Vault does not match the project.
3. Did the function run but fail? `ingest_state.last_error` holds the message, and the Edge
   Function logs in the dashboard show the same line. Invoke a function by hand to see the
   summary or error directly:
   ```sh
   curl -X POST https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/functions/v1/ingest-pota \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <SERVICE_ROLE_KEY>"
   ```
4. `ingest_state.last_error` says `numeric field overflow`? That was
   `raw_spots.frequency_khz` at `numeric(10,3)` rejecting 10 GHz spots; migration
   `20261006000012` widened it. Make sure `supabase db push` has run.
5. Did the function run and simply skip everything? The response body's `skipped.too_old` counter
   is high when the upstream feed only had old spots (quiet band, or the function was down and is
   catching up). That is normal.

## Dead letter queue

Individual spots that could not be normalized:

```sql
select id, source, occurred_at, error, raw_payload
from ingest_failures order by occurred_at desc limit 20;

-- Which errors are most common?
select source, error, count(*) from ingest_failures
where occurred_at > now() - interval '1 day'
group by 1, 2 order by 3 desc;
```

## Temporarily disable a source

```sql
select cron.alter_job(job_id := jobid, active := false) from cron.job where jobname = 'ingest-pota';
-- later
select cron.alter_job(job_id := jobid, active := true) from cron.job where jobname = 'ingest-pota';
```

`cron.unschedule('ingest-pota')` removes the job entirely; re-running the cron migration
recreates it.

## Replay a failed spot

A failure is usually a normalizer bug or an upstream shape change. After fixing and redeploying
the function, the spot will be picked up again on the next run if it is still in the upstream
feed and under five minutes old. Otherwise, replay by hand with the stored payload: build the
normalized row yourself and call the same RPC the functions use.

```sql
select public.ingest_spots(jsonb_build_array(jsonb_build_object(
  'source', 'pota',
  'source_spot_id', '58161241',
  'content_hash', encode(sha256(convert_to('<spotTime>\n<activator>\n<reference>\n<frequency>\n<mode>\n<comments>', 'utf8')), 'hex'),
  'spot_time', '2026-10-05T13:37:03Z',
  'callsign', 'DL/HB9JNH',
  'spotter', 'OK1HRA',
  'frequency_khz', 10123.9,
  'band', '30m',
  'mode', 'cw',
  'mode_family', 'cw',
  'comment', 'RBN 22 dB 19 WPM via OK1HRA-#',
  'pota_reference', 'DE-0858',
  'pota_park_name', 'Via Sancti Martini National Historic Trail',
  'pota_location', 'DE-BW,DE-BY,DE-RP,DE-SL',
  'raw_payload', (select raw_payload from ingest_failures where id = <FAILURE_ID>)
)));

delete from ingest_failures where id = <FAILURE_ID>;
```

The RPC inserts the row and enqueues its `spot_events` message in one transaction, and the unique
constraint still applies, so a replay cannot create a duplicate.

## Queue

```sql
select * from pgmq.metrics('spot_events');
select msg_id, enqueued_at, message from pgmq.q_spot_events order by msg_id desc limit 10;
```

Nothing consumes the queue in Phase 1, so `queue_length` grows with `total_messages`.

# Phase 2

## Supabase Auth settings (dashboard, once)

Authentication → URL configuration:

- Site URL: `https://app.longlines.io`
- Redirect URLs: `https://app.longlines.io`, `https://app.longlines.io/set-password`
  (add `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:5173/set-password` for local
  development against the hosted project)

Authentication → Providers → Email: enable "Confirm email". Leave signups on.

Authentication → SMTP: configure a custom SMTP provider. Supabase's built-in
mailer only delivers to members of your organization and is rate limited, so
sign-up confirmations and password resets for real users will not arrive
without it.

## Edge Function deploys

`sign-in` is public (`verify_jwt = false` in `config.toml`); the others require a
user or service-role JWT. Deploy with:

```sh
supabase functions deploy sign-in
supabase functions deploy delete-account
```

## Sign-in rate limiting

`sign_in_attempts` logs every attempt. To see who is being throttled:

```sql
select identifier, count(*) from sign_in_attempts
where attempted_at > now() - interval '15 minutes'
group by 1 having count(*) >= 10;
```

Rows older than a day are deleted by the daily housekeeping job.

## Database tests

`supabase/tests/*.test.sql` are pgTAP suites that run against a fresh local
database (`supabase db start` or `supabase start`, then `supabase test db`). CI
runs them on every PR. `supabase/tests/helpers/users.psql` seeds two users and
an `as_user(uuid)` helper that switches to the `authenticated` role with that
user's JWT claims, which is how the RLS assertions work.

## Delivery

Deploy the two delivery functions after `supabase db push`:

```sh
supabase functions deploy deliver
supabase functions deploy send-test
```

`deliver` is called by cron every minute and by the matcher; both use the Vault
secrets from Phase 1, so nothing new to configure.

### Is anything flowing?

```sql
select status, count(*) from deliveries where created_at > now() - interval '1 hour' group by 1;
select * from pgmq.metrics('deliveries_queue');
select name, type, health, consecutive_failures, last_error, last_error_at, last_success_at
from destinations order by health desc, last_error_at desc nulls last;
select jobname, status, return_message, start_time
from cron.job_run_details d join cron.job j using (jobid)
where jobname in ('match-pending-spots', 'deliver') order by start_time desc limit 10;
```

### A destination keeps failing

`destinations.last_error` holds the upstream status or the safety-check
message. Retries follow 30 s, 1 m, 2 m, 5 m, 15 m, then every 30 m, for 24
hours; after that the delivery is `dropped`. To stop retrying without deleting
the destination:

```sql
update destinations set health = 'paused' where id = '<id>';
-- later
update destinations set health = 'ok', consecutive_failures = 0 where id = '<id>';
```

Paused destinations are skipped by the worker; their messages wait in the
queue and are dropped at 24 hours like any other.

### Local development

The worker refuses plain-http and private addresses. To exercise delivery
against a receiver on your own machine, set
`LONGLINES_ALLOW_INSECURE_DESTINATIONS=1` in `supabase/functions/.env` (read by
`supabase functions serve`) and insert the destination row directly in SQL;
`create_destination()` will not accept such a URL. Never set this on the hosted
project.

### Housekeeping

A daily job (`housekeeping`, 03:00 UTC) deletes deliveries and archived queue
messages older than 7 days and sign-in attempts older than a day.

### Stats snapshot

An hourly job (`refresh-stats-snapshot`, five past every hour) runs `refresh_stats_snapshot()`,
which inserts one `stats_snapshots` row for the last seven complete UTC days and prunes the table
to 48 rows. The Stats page shows the newest row; on a fresh project it shows "Not enough data yet"
until the first run. To refresh by hand:

```sql
select refresh_stats_snapshot();
select generated_at, payload->'totals' from stats_snapshots order by generated_at desc limit 1;
```

`cron.job_run_details` shows failed runs under that job name.

## Web app on Vercel

Create a Vercel project from the GitHub repo with these settings:

- Root directory: `web`
- Framework preset: Vite (build `npm run build`, output `dist`)
- Environment variables: with the Supabase ↔ Vercel integration enabled, the
  project receives `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (plus `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
  copies and the service-role key) automatically. `web/vite.config.ts` maps
  only the URL and the anon key onto the `VITE_` names the app reads; the
  service-role key is never read and never reaches the bundle. Without the
  integration, set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (or the `VITE_`
  names) by hand.
- Domain: `app.longlines.io`

`web/vercel.json` rewrites every path to `index.html` so client-side routes
load directly. Nothing else is host-specific; `npm run build` produces a plain
static site in `web/dist`.

After the first deploy, make sure Supabase Auth → URL configuration lists
`https://app.longlines.io` as the Site URL and includes
`https://app.longlines.io/set-password` in the redirect URLs, or confirmation
and reset links will not land in the app.

## Regenerating database types

Whenever a migration changes a table, view or RPC the app uses:

```sh
supabase start   # or db start
supabase gen types typescript --local > web/src/lib/database.types.ts
```

The generated file is committed; CI type-checks the app against it.
