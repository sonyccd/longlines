# Webhook destinations

Long Lines delivers matching spots to a webhook destination with an HTTPS
`POST`. Each request carries up to 50 spots and is signed with the
destination's signing secret, which is shown once when the destination is
created (and again when rotated).

## Request

```
POST <your url>
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: LongLines/0.2
X-LongLines-Timestamp: 1759676400
X-LongLines-Signature: sha256=3f1c…
```

```json
{
  "deliveries": [
    {
      "delivery_id": 1234,
      "subscription_id": "7d7221c8-f4d9-4955-a976-ece92b4735b8",
      "spot": {

        "callsign": "DL/HB9JNH",
        "spotter": "OK1HRA",

        "pota_park_name": "Via Sancti Martini National Historic Trail",
        "pota_location": "DE-BW,DE-BY,DE-RP,DE-SL",

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`spot` has the same fields as the `recent_spots` view. `delivery_id` is unique
per spot and destination, so you can use it to deduplicate retries.

Respond with any `2xx` status within 10 seconds. Redirects are never followed,
so a `3xx` counts as a failure; point the destination at the final URL.
Anything else, including a timeout, is a failure: the batch is retried with backoff (30 s, 1 m, 2 m, 5 m,
15 m, then every 30 m) for up to 24 hours, after which it is dropped. Five
consecutive failures mark the destination "Failing" in the app; the next
success clears it.

A "Send test" from the app delivers one sample spot whose callsign is `N0CALL`
and whose comment says it is a test; `delivery_id` and `subscription_id` are
zero-valued.

## Verifying the signature

The signature is an HMAC-SHA256, hex encoded, over the string
`"{timestamp}.{raw body}"` using your signing secret as the key. Compute it
from the exact bytes you received, before parsing the JSON, and compare in
constant time. Reject timestamps more than a few minutes old to limit replay.

```ts
// Node 18+ / Deno / Bun
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

export function verifyLongLines(
  secret: string,
  headers: Headers,
  rawBody: string,
  maxSkewSeconds = 300,
): boolean {
  const timestamp = headers.get("x-longlines-timestamp") ?? "";
  const signature = headers.get("x-longlines-signature") ?? "";
  if (!/^\d+$/.test(timestamp) || !signature.startsWith("sha256=")) return false;
  if (Math.abs(Date.now() / 1000 - Number(timestamp)) > maxSkewSeconds) return false;

  const expected = "sha256=" + createHmac("sha256", secret).update(`${timestamp}.${rawBody}`).digest("hex");
  const a = Buffer.from(expected);
  const b = Buffer.from(signature);
  return a.length === b.length && timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}
```

Express example:

```ts
app.post("/spots", express.raw({ type: "application/json" }), (req, res) => {
  const raw = req.body.toString("utf8");
  if (!verifyLongLines(process.env.LONGLINES_SECRET!, new Headers(req.headers as Record<string, string>), raw)) {
    return res.status(401).end();
  }
  const { deliveries } = JSON.parse(raw);
  // ... handle spots ...
  res.status(204).end();
});
```

## Rotating the secret

Rotate from the Destinations page. The new secret takes effect for the next
delivery; update your receiver first if you cannot tolerate a brief window
of rejected requests.

## Address rules

Webhook URLs must use `https`, and the hostname may not be `localhost` or an
IP address in a private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT or unspecified range. The
delivery worker also resolves the hostname before each request and refuses
hosts that resolve to such addresses.
