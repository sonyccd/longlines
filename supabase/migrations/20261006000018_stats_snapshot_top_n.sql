-- Redefines refresh_stats_snapshot() from 20261006000015_stats_snapshots.sql
-- with three changes; the payload shape and every pgTAP assertion are unchanged.
--
-- 1. The CW pie bucket follows mode_family instead of the literal 'cw', so
--    any spelling _shared/modes.ts files as CW counts. The other buckets stay
--    exact mode strings; see the comment on the modes CTE.
-- 2. activator_bands is computed only for the eight kept activators instead
--    of every (callsign, band) pair in the week.
-- 3. The POTA park name is looked up only for the eight kept references
--    instead of being aggregated for every reference in the week.
--
-- The revoke is restated so the function's ACL does not depend on
-- create or replace preserving it.
